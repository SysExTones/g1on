The sysex_tones project goal is control of amp modelers via text settings files and MIDI SysEx.

Currently, only tested platform is GNU/Linux and the Zoom G1on with BIOS v 1.21.  Recent versions of the Linux kernel should recognize the G1on as a USB MIDI device automatically.  If you use some other operating system, maybe you'll be lucky and this project will work as is.

Currently, the only control available is via command line example apps, written in Python.

If you are not comfortable with Python code, or not comfortable with command lines, you should wait until this project matures.  End user support is not available.

If you install this somewhere and export PYTHONPATH=somewhere you should be able to run the example apps in the apps directory.

Start with the edit.mode.py and listen.py examples.  They will need the name of the system file for reading/writing MIDI for communication with the G1on.  Try something from /dev/midi* or /dev/snd/midi*.  First run edit.mode.py to turn on 'edit mode' on the G1on.  Then run listen.py and edit a patch parameter on the G1on to see what MIDI traffic is generated.

If you are successful monitoring the G1on, try viewing patch settings with the request.patch.py example.  It will need the name of system files for reading and writing MIDI to/from the G1on.  Try something from /dev/midi* and /dev/snd/midi*.

If you are successful viewing patches, try reading and writing patches using the send.patch.py and save.patches.py examples.

If you want to develop apps using this code as a library, comply with the license.  And don't be suprised if the API changes, this is a rough first pass, without access to G1on MIDI SysEx documentation, so changes are likely.
